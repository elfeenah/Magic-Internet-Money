        <h2>About the Project</h2>
        <p>The Magic Internet Money Payment System is a visionary initiative by Qala Africa to promote financial inclusion and innovation across Africa. This repository showcases the development of a project aimed at integrating Bitcoin and the Lightning Network to empower individuals with seamless, secure, and convenient payment solutions. This project demonstrates a basic working knowledge of Bitcoin and the Lightning Network by building a simple application for accepting payments and providing confirmation to the user. It's meant to serve as a learning exercise and starting point for understanding cryptocurrency payment workflows.</p>

        <h2>Important Notes</h2>
        <p>This example is for educational purposes and might not include all necessary security measures or edge case handling for a production environment. Use caution when working with real cryptocurrencies and consider using testnet or signet for development and testing.</p>
        <p>Ensure you have set up a local Bitcoin node or have access to a testnet node to fetch blockchain data. Modify the script to use the appropriate RPC URL for your node.</p>
